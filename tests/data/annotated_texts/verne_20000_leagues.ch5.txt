The voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was for a long time marked by no special incident. But one circumstance happened which showed
the wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might place in him.

The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal. But
one of them, the captain of the Monroe, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the Abraham Lincoln, begged for his help in
chasing a whale they had in sight. Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave him permission to go on board
the Monroe. And fate served our Canadian so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double blow, striking one
straight to the heart, and catching the other after some minutes’ pursuit.

Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land’s harpoon, I would not bet in its favour.

The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great rapidity. The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits
of Magellan, level with Cape Vierges. But Commander Farragut would not take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.
