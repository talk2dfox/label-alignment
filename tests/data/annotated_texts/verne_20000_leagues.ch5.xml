<p>The voyage of the <vessel>Abraham Lincoln</vessel> was for a long time marked by no special incident. But one circumstance happened which showed the wonderful dexterity of <person>Ned Land</person>, and proved what confidence we might place in him.</p>

<p>The <date>30th of June,</date> the frigate spoke some <nationality>American</nationality> whalers, from whom we learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal. But one of them, the captain of the <vessel>Monroe</vessel>, knowing that <person>Ned Land</person> had shipped on board the <vessel>Abraham Lincoln</vessel>, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in sight. <person>Commander Farragut</person>, desirous of seeing <person>Ned Land</person> at work, gave him permission to go on board the Monroe. And fate served our Canadian so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other after some minutes’ pursuit.</p>

<p>Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with <person>Ned Land</person>’s harpoon, I would not bet in its favour.</p>

<p>The frigate skirted the south-east coast of <country>America</country> with great rapidity. The <date>3rd of July</date> we were at the opening of the <place>Straits of Magellan</place>, level with <place>Cape Vierges</place>. But <person>Commander Farragut</person> would not take a tortuous passage, but doubled <place>Cape Horn</place>.</p>
